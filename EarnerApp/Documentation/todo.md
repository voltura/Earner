Ideas for future versions
=========================

- Create create user / login
	Online database to store credentials
	User / password / email
	Site to login and reset password via mail

- Save json to cloud per user, read json from cloud if logged in, 
	running Earner on multiple PC's can keep track of logged work for user

- Generate invoice based on work log, template for invoice, auto increase invoice number based on month etc.

- Administer work tasks log via UI table style, remove, modify, add record manually
